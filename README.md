# Strike Force v3.0 - Advanced Subdomain Enumeration Tool  

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  

## Overview  

**Strike Force v3.0** is a powerful subdomain enumeration tool built for penetration testers and security researchers. It uses multiple data sources to discover subdomains, perform DNS brute-forcing, and optionally scan open ports. This tool is perfect for uncovering hidden infrastructure and mapping attack surfaces.  

---  

## Features  

- **Comprehensive Subdomain Enumeration**:  
  Aggregates results from multiple sources like Certificate Transparency logs, DNS Dumpster, Wayback Machine, and HackerTarget.  
- **DNS Brute-Forcing**: Use custom wordlists to find additional subdomains.  
- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports on discovered subdomains.  
- **Progress Tracking**: Includes progress bars to monitor task execution.  
- **Detailed Results**: Save results to a file for further analysis.

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/variendarkgril/StrikeForce.git  
   cd strike-force  
   ```  

2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

---  

## Usage  

Run the tool with the target domain as an argument:  

```bash  
python3 SrtikeForce.py example.com  
```  

### Key Arguments  

- **Domain** (Required): Specify the target domain (e.g., `example.com`).  
- **Wordlist**: Use a custom wordlist for DNS brute-forcing.  
  ```bash  
  -w /path/to/wordlist.txt  
  ```  
- **Custom Ports**: Define ports for scanning.  
  ```bash  
  -p 80 443 8080  
  ```  
- **Save Results**: Save output to a file.  
  ```bash  
  -o results.txt  
  ```  
- **Port Scanning**: Enable scanning for open ports.  
  ```bash  
  -open-ports  
  ```  

#### Full Example:  
```bash  
python3 SrtikeForce.py example.com -w wordlist.txt -p 22 80 443 -o results.txt -open-ports  
```  

---  

## Configuration  

Customizable settings within the script:  
- **`COMMON_PORTS`**: Default ports to scan.  
- **`MAX_WORKERS`**: Number of threads for concurrency.  
- **`REQUEST_TIMEOUT`**: Timeout for network requests.  

---  

## Data Sources  

The tool gathers subdomains from:  
1. **Certificate Transparency Logs**: Queries `crt.sh`.  
2. **DNS Dumpster**: Scrapes `dnsdumpster.com`.  
3. **Wayback Machine**: Extracts URLs from the Internet Archive.  
4. **HackerTarget**: Fetches subdomains via API.  
5. **Brute-Force**: Finds subdomains using a wordlist.
